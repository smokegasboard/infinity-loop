**Description:**
This Python script automates the opening and closing of a specified application with a customizable delay.

**Usage:**
Ensure you have Python installed.

1. **Edit the script:**
   - Open the `looper.py` file in a text editor.
   - Replace `YOUR PATH` with the desired application path.
   - Adjust the `delay` variable to set the desired time between opening and closing.
2. **Run the script:**

   ```
3. **Stop the script:**
   Press `Ctrl+C` to terminate the script.

**Dependencies:**
